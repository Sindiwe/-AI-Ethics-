## ✅ Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

This section includes:
- Definitions of key AI ethics concepts like bias, transparency, and GDPR.
- Matching ethical principles to responsible AI practices.

## 🧠 Part 2: Case Study Analysis

Two real-world AI failure scenarios are analyzed:
1. **Amazon’s biased hiring tool**
2. **Facial recognition in policing**

Each case includes:
- Source of bias
- Proposed solutions
- Ethical risks
- Fairness evaluation metrics and policies

## ⚖️ Part 3: Practical Bias Audit with COMPAS Dataset

Using the **COMPAS Recidivism Dataset** and IBM’s **AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)**:
- Audit for racial bias in recidivism risk scores
- Compare false positive rates between racial groups
- Apply the **Reweighing** technique to mitigate bias
- Visualize disparities before and after mitigation
- Includes a 300-word PDF report

📊 Tools used:
- Python
- scikit-learn
- aif360
- matplotlib
